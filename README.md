# TruckRoute
Here's an example of a simple JavaScript code that uses the Bing Maps Truck Routing API to retrieve driving directions for a semi-truck
This code uses the fetch API to retrieve truck routing information from the Bing Maps API. The getTruckRoute function takes in two arguments, start and end, which are the starting and ending locations for the truck route. The function constructs a URL using the API endpoint, API key, and the starting and ending locations. The fetch function is used to make a request to the API, and the response is processed as a JSON object. The route variable is used to store the routing information and log relevant details, such as the driving distance and travel time, to the console. If an error occurs while retrieving the routing information, it is logged to the console.
